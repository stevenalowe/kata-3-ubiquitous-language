Welcome to Step 4!

The engineers are delighted with the contract tests, thank you! They're already running it as part of their build chain, and it caught a bug for them just this morning. They're so happy, in fact, that they're willing to take a look at changing the Grooble Api to something that makes more domain sense. Yay!

Only...what should it be?

If we look at how we use it, the Api.hit() method corresponds to Smack.boom(), so perhaps we should rename hit to boom?

If we do that, is that enough? The rehit() method should be renamed also, and while we're at it, let's make custom exceptions.

Oh, and change the version in the comments to v0.2
